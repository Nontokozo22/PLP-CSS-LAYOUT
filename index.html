    <h1>Best 2000s Cartoons That We'd Still Watch Today</h1>
    <p>
      There was something special about 2000s cartoons. Maybe it’s nostalgia
      talking, but from the animation styles to their often twisted storylines,
      cartoons of this era just hit differently. Thanks to the doors that 1990s
      cartoons had opened, the stories told in a lot of early 2000s cartoons got
      to be more experimental, and the burgeoning influence of Japanese anime
      meant Western cartoons were becoming more visually interesting, too.
      <br />

      Ultimately, compared with whatever the kids are watching nowadays, we’re
      pretty sure 2000s cartoons are wackier and weirder, for the better. (Cut
      to a scene of me googling “what cartoons are the kids watching today” and
      feeling tremendously old.) <br />
      Of course, many of the best 2000s cartoons, from Cartoon Network fan
      favorites to the golden era of Nickelodeon and Disney Channel shows, lived
      on well past their original heyday. A handful are even slated for upcoming
      live-action reprisals. Others, sadly, have slipped into the camp of
      forgotten 2000s cartoons — but that can make them all the more fun to
      reminisce on.
